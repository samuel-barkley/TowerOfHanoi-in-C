# TowerOfHanoi

## Introduction

Hi, this is a small console application I have written in C. This is the very first time I used the language. I learned
the language with the help of the website [learn-c.org](https://www.learn-c.org/). I doubt I would have been able to 
pick it up this quick without the help of such a good resource.

## Compatibility

This app works both on windows and macOS. I have tested this on both. As long as the terminal emulator support UTF-8
encoding, all should work as intended. I have not tested if the application works in any flavours of linux. The GitHub
actions build is done on an Ubuntu VM, so it should at least build, but I can not guarantee that it will work.
